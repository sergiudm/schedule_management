# CLI Overview

Schedule Everything provides a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) for managing your schedules, tasks, and system configuration. The CLI tool is automatically installed when you run the installation script.

## Accessing the CLI

After installation, the `rmd` command should be available in your terminal. `reminder` still works as a compatibility alias. If `rmd` is not on your PATH, ensure you've added the following to your shell profile:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/schedule_management:$PATH"
export REMINDER_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/schedule_management/config"
alias rmd="$HOME/schedule_management/rmd"
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Command Categories

The CLI commands are organized into these main categories:

### Schedule Management
Commands for managing your schedule and service:
- [`rmd update`](schedule-management.md#update) - Reload config and restart service
- [`rmd switch`](schedule-management.md#switch) - Change the active `user_config_n` snapshot and reload the service
- [`rmd setup`](schedule-management.md#setup) - Interactive AI-assisted setup powered by OpenCode with profile-first intake, evidence-informed schedule planning, and optional file-aware reasoning
- [`rmd sync`](schedule-management.md#sync) - Generate and confirm today's pomodoro/potato task assignments
- [`rmd view`](schedule-management.md#view) - Generate schedule visualization
- [`rmd status`](schedule-management.md#status) - Show upcoming events, including synced task titles when present
- [`rmd stop`](schedule-management.md#stop) - Stop the alarm service

### Task Management
Commands for managing your task list:
- [`rmd add`](task-management.md#add) - Add or update tasks
- [`rmd rm`](task-management.md#remove) - Remove tasks
- [`rmd ls`](task-management.md#list) - List all tasks
- [`rmd history`](task-management.md#history) - Show recent completed task activities

### Deadline Management
Commands for managing event deadlines:
- [`rmd ddl add`](deadline-management.md#add) - Add or update deadlines
- [`rmd ddl rm`](deadline-management.md#remove) - Remove deadlines
- [`rmd ddl`](deadline-management.md#list) - List all deadlines with urgency status

### Habits
Commands for tracking daily habits:
- [`rmd track [ids...]`](task-management.md#habits) - Log completed habits for today (opens a prompt if no IDs given)

### Reports
Commands for generating productivity reports:
- [`rmd report <type>`](schedule-management.md#report) - Generate weekly or monthly PDF reports

### System Commands
- [`rmd settings`](schedule-management.md#settings) - Interactive TUI for editing `settings.toml` with keyboard navigation (arrows to navigate, Enter to edit, Space to toggle, `s` to save, `q` to quit)
- [`rmd edit <file>`](schedule-management.md#edit) - Open configuration files (`settings`, `odd`, `even`, `deadlines`, `habits`) in your default editor
- `rmd --help` - Show help information

## Configuration Directory

By default, the CLI looks for its config root in:
- `~/schedule_management/config/` (macOS/Linux)

Inside that root, schedule files live under versioned `user_config_n`
directories and shared task data stays under `tasks/`.

You can override this by setting the `REMINDER_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

## Error Handling

The CLI provides clear error messages for common issues:

```bash
# Configuration file not found
Error: settings.toml not found in /Users/username/schedule_management/config/

# Invalid TOML syntax
Error: Invalid TOML syntax in odd_weeks.toml: Expected '=' at line 5

# Service not running
Warning: Schedule management service is not running. Run 'rmd update' to start it.
```

## Exit Codes

The CLI returns standard exit codes:
- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error
- `2` - Configuration error
- `3` - Service error

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Check service status
rmd status

# Add a high-priority task
rmd add "Complete project proposal" 9

# Generate today's synced focus-block plan
rmd sync

# View your schedule
rmd view

# Stop the service
rmd stop
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Update with custom config directory
REMINDER_CONFIG_DIR=/custom/path/config rmd update

# Switch to config snapshot 2 under a custom config root
REMINDER_CONFIG_DIR=/custom/path/config rmd switch 2

# List tasks with verbose output (if supported)
rmd status -v

# Remove multiple tasks
rmd rm "Task 1" "Task 2" "Task 3"
```

## Integration with Other Tools

The CLI can be integrated with other tools and scripts:

```bash
# Use in shell scripts
#!/bin/bash
if rmd status | grep -q "No upcoming events"; then
    echo "Schedule is clear"
fi

# Pipe to other commands
rmd ls | grep "urgent" | wc -l

# Use with cron for automated tasks
0 9 * * * /Users/username/schedule_management/rmd status >> ~/schedule.log
```

## Troubleshooting CLI Issues

### Command Not Found
If you get `command not found: rmd`:
1. Check that the installation completed successfully
2. Verify the PATH includes the installation directory
3. Ensure your shell profile is sourced

### Permission Denied
If you get `Permission denied` errors:
```bash
chmod +x ~/schedule_management/rmd
```

### Configuration Errors
If commands fail with configuration errors:
1. Check that all required files exist in the config directory
2. Validate TOML syntax using an online validator
3. Ensure file permissions are correct
