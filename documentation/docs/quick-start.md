# Quick Start

This guide focuses on the fastest path to a useful schedule.

If you want the AI-assisted flow, start with `rmd setup`.
If you prefer hand-editing TOML, the manual path is included later on this page.

## Fastest Path: AI-Assisted Setup

### 1. Install the project and OpenCode

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sergiudm/schedule-everything.git
cd schedule-everything
./install.sh
./third_party/opencode/install --no-modify-path
```

### 2. Run the profile-first planner

```bash
rmd setup
```

What happens:

- It stores your model settings in `~/.schedule_management/llm.toml`.
- It creates or refines `profile.md` next to your schedule files.
- It asks follow-up questions until that profile is detailed enough to plan from.
- It shows a summary before writing the schedule.

### 3. Add tasks and sync today

```bash
rmd add "Finish proposal draft" 9
rmd add "Review pull request" 7
rmd sync
```

`rmd sync` reads `tasks/tasks.json`, assigns today's untitled
`pomodoro`/`potato` blocks to specific tasks, shows a preview, and only writes
`synced_schedule.toml` after approval.

### 4. Verify and launch

```bash
rmd status
rmd status -v
rmd view
rmd update
```

## Manual Path: Hand-Editing the Schedule

Use this if you want full manual control over the TOML files.

### 1. Create the config files

```bash
mkdir -p ~/schedule_management/config/user_config_0
cp config/settings_template.toml ~/schedule_management/config/user_config_0/settings.toml
cp config/week_schedule_template.toml ~/schedule_management/config/user_config_0/odd_weeks.toml
cp config/week_schedule_template.toml ~/schedule_management/config/user_config_0/even_weeks.toml
```

Later accepted schedule edits create `user_config_1`, `user_config_2`, and so
on under the same config root.

### 2. Define reusable blocks in `settings.toml`

```toml
[settings]
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff"
alarm_interval = 5
max_alarm_duration = 300
show_tasks_after_add = false

[time_blocks]
pomodoro = 25
short_break = 5
long_break = 15
meeting = 60
lunch = 60

[time_points]
bedtime = "Wind down and disconnect 😴"
standup = "Daily Standup Meeting 🗣️"
```

### 3. Map time to actions in `odd_weeks.toml`

```toml
[common]
"12:00" = "lunch"
"23:00" = "bedtime"

[monday]
"09:00" = "pomodoro"
"09:25" = "short_break"
"09:30" = "pomodoro"
"10:00" = { block = "meeting", title = "Weekly Planning" }
```

For a simple weekly schedule, copy the same structure to `even_weeks.toml`.

### 4. Optional: add a synced overlay later

Once you start using tasks, `rmd sync` can generate a daily overlay file:

```toml
[schedule]
"09:00" = { block = "pomodoro", title = "Finish proposal draft" }
```

That overlay lives in `synced_schedule.toml` and does not rewrite your base
odd/even week templates.
