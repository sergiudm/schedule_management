# Settings Configuration

The `settings.toml` file contains global configuration, reusable time blocks, and reminder messages. This file is the foundation of your Schedule Management setup.

## File Structure

```toml
[settings]
# Global system settings

[time_blocks]
# Reusable time block definitions

[time_points]
# Reusable time point message definitions

[task_settings]
# Task management settings (optional)
```

## Settings Section

### Basic Settings

```toml
[settings]
language = "en"
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff"
alarm_interval = 5
max_alarm_duration = 300
show_tasks_after_add = false
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `language` | string | `"en"` | Preferred language. Supported values are `"en"` (English) and `"zh"` (Chinese / 中文). Can also be overridden temporarily via the `REMINDER_LANG` environment variable. |

| `alarm_interval` | integer | `5` | Seconds between repeated alerts |
| `max_alarm_duration` | integer | `300` | Maximum duration for alerts in seconds (5 minutes) |

### Advanced Settings

```toml
[settings]
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"
alarm_interval = 3
max_alarm_duration = 600

```

|-----------|------|-------------|
| `config_dir` | string | Custom configuration directory path |
| `log_level` | string | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |

## Time Blocks Section

Time blocks define reusable durations for scheduled activities. Each time block triggers both start and end notifications.

### Common Time Blocks

```toml
[time_blocks]
pomodoro = 25           # 25-minute work sessions
long_break = 40         # 40-minute breaks
short_break = 5         # 5-minute short breaks
meeting = 50            # 50-minute meetings
exercise = 30           # 30-minute exercise sessions
lunch = 60              # 1-hour lunch break
napping = 30            # 30-minute naps
deep_work = 90          # 90-minute deep work sessions
```

### Custom Time Blocks

You can define any time block that suits your routine:

```toml
[time_blocks]
coding = 45             # 45-minute coding sessions
reading = 20            # 20-minute reading sessions
meditation = 15         # 15-minute meditation
standup = 15            # 15-minute standup meetings
review = 30             # 30-minute review sessions
planning = 20           # 20-minute planning sessions
```

## Time Points Section

Time points define reusable messages for one-time reminders.

### Common Time Points

```toml
[time_points]
go_to_bed = "Time to wind down and get ready for bed 😴"
summary_time = "Great work today! Time to summarize your accomplishments 🎉"
wake_up = "Good morning! Time to start your day 🌅"
lunch_time = "Lunch time! Take a break and nourish yourself 🍽️"
stretch_time = "Time to stand up and stretch your body 🧘"
hydrate = "Remember to drink some water 💧"
```

### Custom Time Points

Create time points that match your routine:

```toml
[time_points]
check_email = "Time to check and respond to emails 📧"
daily_standup = "Daily standup meeting starts now 👥"
code_review = "Time to review pull requests 🔍"
retrospective = "Sprint retrospective meeting 📝"
demo_time = "Demo time! Show your work 🎬"
retrospect = "Time to reflect on your day 🤔"
```

## Task Settings Section (Optional)

Configure task management behavior:

```toml
[task_settings]
max_tasks = 100                 # Maximum number of tasks
default_importance = 5          # Default importance level (1-10)
auto_cleanup_days = 30          # Auto-cleanup completed tasks after N days
show_completed = false          # Show completed tasks in list
```

## Sound File Configuration

### macOS System Sounds
```toml
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff"
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff"
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff"
```

### Custom Sound Files
```toml
sound_file = "/Users/yourname/Music/notification.wav"
sound_file = "/Users/yourname/Music/gentle-chime.mp3"
